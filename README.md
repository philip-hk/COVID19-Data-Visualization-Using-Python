# COVID19-Data-Visualization-Using-Python

By the end of this project, you will learn How you can use data visualization techniques to answer some analytical questions. in this project we are going to use the COVID19 dataset we have consisting of the data related a cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, and deaths cases. we are gonna prepare this dataset to answer these questions: How does Global Spread of the virus look like? How intensive the spread of the virus has been in the countries?, Does covid19 national lockdowns and self-isolations in different countries have actually an impact on COVID19 transmission? we are going to use the Plotly module, which is a great visualization tool in python, in order to plot some insightful and intuitive graphs to answer the questions.

# Learning Objectives

* Understanding the purpose of the project, the dataset that will be used, and the questions that will be answered with the analysis.
* Using Choropleth map to Visualize Global Spread of COVID-19 from first day of the pandemic
* Using a Bar chart to compare different countries in terms of How massive the Spread of the virus has been in there
* Visualizing the impact of the national lockdown in Italy on the spread of the virus
* Visualizing the impact of the national lockdown in Italy on the deaths rate
